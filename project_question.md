#### What do you know about the data so far?
Head Coach Matty Tsang and Assistant Coach Andrew Lovseth, have coached two perennial powerhouse teams (in the San Fracisco Fury and Seattle Riot respectively) for the past several years. Both (particularly Coach Tsang) are noted to use even subbing strategies despite both Fury and Riot being filled with players considered some of the best in the division--athletically and skills-wise. Even players on those teams widely regarded as "all-stars" do not stand out statistically above the rest.

In the 2013 and 2014 club championships, Fury's goal and assist statistics were spread widely among the roster, whereas their opponents (D.C. Scandal) scored using mostly the same handful of players. Conclusion is that Scandal relied more on their "all-star" power, whereas Fury relied on having a deep roster.

Both Fury and Riot also place heavy emphasis on sportsmanship and player conduct. I hypothesize that this is a reflection of the coaches' priorities and would like to predict how player conduct may weigh in on the selection process.

Finally, I hope to gain a little insight on Coach Tsang's selection process by exploring data on the 2013 World Games roster. The 2013 World Games team was co-ed and the team for which I'm making predictions is women's, therefore this will be somewhat an apples to oranges comparison. However, all of the women on the 2013 World Games Roster are trying out for the women's team this year, and so I hope to gain some insight by exploring that data.

#### Why did you choose this topic?
I chose this topic because I am trying out for a roster spot January 30-31. In addition to being curious about my own chances of making the roster, I'm curious of who the top prospects are. Based on my experience competing against many of the other tryouts, I have an anecdotal sense of who will take the roster spots, but I would like to see if available data support my notions. I also have anecdotal experience being coached by Matt Tsang and know that he prefers to have a deep roster and puts heavy emphasis on team culture and sportmanship, but I'd like to also test those notions with data.
