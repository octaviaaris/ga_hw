# Project Question

### What question do you hope to answer?
I would like to predict who will make the Team USA women's roster for the 2016 World Ultimate Guts Championship. 

### What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

### What do you know about the data so far?
The two coaches, Matty Tsang and Andrew Lovseth, have coached two perennial powerhouse teams (in the Bay Area and Seattle respectively) for the past several years. Head Coach Tsang is especially known for his even subbing strategy and both have teams stacked with "role" players. Even players on those teams who are widely regarded as some of the best in the division do not stand out above the rest in terms of player statistics.

### Why did you chose this topic?
I chose this topic because I am trying out for a roster spot at the end of January. In addition to being curious about my own chances of making the roster, I'm curious of who the top prospects are. Based on my experience competing against many of the other tryouts, I have an anecdotal sense of who will take the roster spots, but I would like to see if available data support my notions.
